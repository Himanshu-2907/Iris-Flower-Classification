## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using their physical attributes such as sepal and petal length and width. This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
- Training and evaluating a Logistic Regression model.
- Visualization of patterns in the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with the following attributes:
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width (in centimeters)
- **Target**: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset is balanced with 50 samples for each species and is widely used for classification problems.
