## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using their physical attributes such as sepal and petal length and width. This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
- Training and evaluating a Logistic Regression model.
- Visualization of patterns in the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with the following attributes:
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width (in centimeters)
- **Target**: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset is balanced with 50 samples for each species and is widely used for classification problems.

## Usage

- **EDA**: Explore the dataset through visualizations like pair plots and correlation heatmaps.
- **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s accuracy and interpret results.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of **\~100%** on the test set. This high performance demonstrates the model's ability to distinguish between the three Iris species effectively.

---

## Potential Applications

1. **Botanical Research**: Automating the classification of flower species.
2. **Education**: Teaching machine learning fundamentals with a simple, well-known dataset.
3. **Agriculture**: Identifying plant species or indicators of plant health.
4. **Medical Diagnosis**: Extending the methodology to classify medical images.
